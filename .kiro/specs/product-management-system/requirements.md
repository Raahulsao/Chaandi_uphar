# Product Management System Requirements

## Introduction

This feature will create a complete product management system for the luxury jewelry e-commerce platform. The system will allow administrators to upload, manage, and display products through an admin interface, with all products automatically appearing on the main website through API-based data fetching.

## Requirements

1. WHEN an admin accesses the admin panel THEN the system SHALL display a product management interface
2. WHEN an admin uploads a product with images THEN the system SHALL store the product data in the database
3. WHEN an admin uploads product images THEN the system SHALL use Cloudinary for image storage and optimization
4. WHEN an admin creates a product THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields (name, price, category, description)
5. WHEN an admin saves a product THEN the system SHALL generate a unique product ID and slug
6. WHEN an admin updates a product THEN the system SHALL maintain version history and update timestamps

### Requirement 2

3. WHEN a customer views a product THEN the system SHALL display all product details, images, and pricing
4. WHEN products are displayed THEN the system SHALL show only active/published products
5. WHEN product images are loaded THEN the system SHALL use optimized Cloudinary URLs for fast loading
6. WHEN a customer filters products THEN the system SHALL apply filters for price, category, and availability

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to manage product categories and inventory, so that I can organize the catalog effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin creates categories THEN the system SHALL allow hierarchical category structures
2. WHEN an admin sets inventory levels THEN the system SHALL track stock quantities
3. WHEN inventory reaches low levels THEN the system SHALL provide alerts to administrators
4. WHEN a product is out of stock THEN the system SHALL display appropriate messaging to customers
5. WHEN an admin bulk updates products THEN the system SHALL process multiple products efficiently
6. WHEN categories are updated THEN the system SHALL update all associated product URLs and navigation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system, I want to provide robust API endpoints for product data, so that the frontend can efficiently fetch and display product information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend requests products THEN the API SHALL return paginated results with proper metadata
2. WHEN product data is requested THEN the API SHALL include optimized image URLs and pricing
3. WHEN the API receives invalid requests THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages
4. WHEN products are fetched THEN the API SHALL support filtering, sorting, and search parameters
5. WHEN product details are requested THEN the API SHALL return complete product information including related products
6. WHEN the database is unavailable THEN the API SHALL handle errors gracefully without exposing sensitive information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean database schema and API architecture, so that the system is maintainable and scalable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database schema is created THEN it SHALL include proper indexes for performance
2. WHEN API routes are implemented THEN they SHALL follow RESTful conventions
3. WHEN data is stored THEN the system SHALL use proper data types and constraints
4. WHEN images are uploaded THEN the system SHALL validate file types and sizes
5. WHEN products are created THEN the system SHALL generate SEO-friendly URLs
6. WHEN the system scales THEN the architecture SHALL support caching and optimization
